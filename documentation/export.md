# Export

You can export data in 2 ways, which one you choose depends on your use case and your background:

1. Use the `API` if your dataset is continuously growing and you constantly have to export the newly annotate data. The API provides seamless integration into your machine learning pipelines.
2. Use the `User Interface` if your export is needed form time to time \(once a week or less\). Or you need your data in a dedicated format, we currently support various Formats like \(CSV, JSON, and Google AutoML\)

## API \(recommended\)
