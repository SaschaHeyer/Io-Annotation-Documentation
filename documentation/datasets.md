## Create dataset
A dataset consists of a name, type and optional a description.
We currently support two types of datasets `Text Classifications` and `Named Entity Recognition`

## Delete dataset
If you want to delete a dataset please keep in mind this process cannot be reverted, your data will be lost. A dataset can be deleted by navigating to the detail page and click on delete, confirm with the word `DELETE`.
