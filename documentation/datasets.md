# Datasets


A dataset is the parent of your data and contains everything which is related to your data. If you have new data add them to your already existing dataset and continue annotating. 

Lets start by navigating to 
[/datasets](https://io-annotator.appspot.com/datasets). If you are new your dataset list is empty. Create a new dataset by navigating to [/datasets/create](https://io-annotator.appspot.com/datasets/create)

Currently we support two types of datasets:

* Text Classifications (Annotate the complete text with one or multiple labels)
* Named Entity Recognition
(Annotate words within a text with on or multiple labels)

The annotation type depends which sort of machine learning problem you want to solve.
