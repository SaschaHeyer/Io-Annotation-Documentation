# Import

You can upload data in 2 ways, which one you choose depends on your use case and your background:

1. Use the `API` if your dataset is continuously growing and you constantly have to import new data. The API provides seamless integration into your machine learning pipelines.
2. Use the `User Interface` if you annotate a dataset which more or less fixes and rather small. 

## API \(recommended\)

Please see the dedicated [API documentation](https://github.com/SaschaHeyer/Io-Annotation-Documentation/tree/a3b5064a2c96e40a372abb115a240d6e004e2e6e/api/introduction.html).

## User Interface

The UI provides a limited way to upload files up to several hundred files. If you have more files we recommend to use the API. To upload files use to browse or drop your files. We currently support .txt files.
