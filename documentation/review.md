# Review

A review can increase the quality of your dataset. This step is optional and depends on your resources and the type of data.

## Review filtering
The review interfaces provide several actions that can be used 
* Filter based on `start date` (show all annotations from this start date to today).
* Filter based on `end date` (show all annotations from the beginning of time till this end date)
* Filter based on `start date` and `end date` (show me all annotations between start and end)

::: tip 
Please keep in mind the filtering is based on UTC.

## Review actions

For each text you can choose between two actions 
* `decline` which moves the text again into the annotation process. It will be marked as declined to show the annotator it failed the review.
* `exclude` in case the text should not be used anymore, it will then not be used during export and is not displayed in the annotator anymore.
