# Annotate

The annotator is your main tool to annotate your data in a fast way. 
We optimized our annotator to reduce distraction by keeping the interface to a minimum.

* The `labels` are displayed in the upper row.
* You can navigate to the next text either by clicking `Next`
 in the upper right corner. Or using the shortcut `enter`.
* Labels can be selected by using the corresponding shortcuts in our example `r` for a room. You can define the shortcuts on your own.
